// Package kueuequeues decides which Kueue Workloads belong to a queue, from
// what the Workloads and LocalQueues say now. It reads no cache and checks no
// access: callers hand it the objects the caller could read, and say where
// the LocalQueues were read.
//
// A Workload belongs to a ClusterQueue in two independent ways. Submission:
// its spec.queueName names a LocalQueue in its namespace whose current
// spec.clusterQueue is the ClusterQueue. Reservation: its
// status.admission.clusterQueue names the ClusterQueue. Submission is a join
// through the LocalQueue as it is now, by name; it says nothing about which
// LocalQueue the Workload was submitted through, nor where it pointed then.
// A Workload belongs to a LocalQueue by submission only: its spec.queueName
// names it, in its namespace.
//
// The cases the two ways disagree on are answered as they are reported:
//   - A LocalQueue re-created to point at another ClusterQueue while a
//     Workload still reports its reservation in the old one: the Workload
//     belongs to the old ClusterQueue by reservation and to the new one by
//     submission, and its row in either names both.
//   - A finished Workload still reporting its admission belongs by
//     reservation: the record names the ClusterQueue, though Kueue released
//     the quota and leaves it out of its own counts.
//   - A Workload being deleted keeps its membership until it is gone: Kueue
//     holds its quota until its finalizer runs.
//   - A Workload belonging both ways is one member with both kinds.
