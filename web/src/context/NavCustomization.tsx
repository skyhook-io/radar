//
// The `embedded` flag hides chrome that only makes sense for Radar's
// standalone OSS binary: GitHub star link, update-from-GitHub notifier,
// Radar's own OIDC/proxy-mode UserMenu. Consumers typically provide
// their own auth UI via `rightExtras`.
//
// Default (no provider): Radar renders its standalone nav unchanged.
